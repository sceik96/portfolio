      <p>Usability Expert is the name of a minor I did on the Hague University. A minor is a subject of choice which you spend 400 hours on over a period of 10 weeks. We were put into contact with thee companies who wanted our help with testing certain points of their products. <br><br> The first company was SurfSpot. They wanted us to run a broad usability test covering the navigation of their website, and the reachability of some of their products. <br><br> The second assignment was for an archive-branch of the Dutch government. They wanted us to provide them with some advice as to wether the articles were easy to find, and what could be done better. <br><br> The third company was Nettie, a schedule-service where different caregivers could divide certain tasks between eachother. The owner wanted to expand the app and wanted some insight on how the current users experience the app and what could be added in the future. <br><br> The links below will lead you to each respective assignment.</p>
