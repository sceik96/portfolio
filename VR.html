        In a team of four we were given a week to work on a VR project of our own choice and just see how far we could get. It didn't take long for us to agree on a VR boxing type of game, the idea of which came from the Wii Sports boxing minigame. Keep in mind that none of us had ever designed a game of any sorts before. We went from not even knowing what program to use to the result shown below.

        <p class="text1">It didn't take long for us to decide what we wanted to create. We were inspired by the boxing simulator on the first Wii-Sports where you hold two controllers and punch your opponent, as you do with boxing.  </p>

        <div class="img2"></div>

        <p class="text2">We decided that we were going to build the program in Unreal Editor, because it's a very friendly program for new users. We appointed tasks and got to work.</p>

        <div class="img3"></div>

        <p class="text3">It was my task to make some boxing gloves for the player to pick up. They had to be able to interact with the players movement and of course with the environment so the stuff that the player punched would actually fly away.</p>

        <div class="img4"></div>

        <p class="text4">We built a map, added NPC's and gave them the instruction to follow the player wherever they went. It was a lot of fun to make and we gave people a good way to manage their anger &#128540; <br> <br> Check out a short video below!</p>
