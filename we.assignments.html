      <p><strong>"You owe me a high-five!"</strong><br>

      Nowadays people draw the most insane works of art on their body in the form of a tattoo. The images they portrey range from personally meaningful text to complete renaissance-esque paintings. They all have one thing in common though, they all serve an aestethic purpose in the end.
      <br><br>
      What if we could give tattoos a more functional purpose? Imagine being able to pay your bills with a bio-integrated tattoo in your hand. Combined with your unique DNA, this has loads of practical potential, other than just pleasing the eye.
      <br><br>
      Here's a scenario. You and a couple of friends went out for dinner and after the dessert the waiter brings you the bill. Before, you would had to calculate the amount each person is owed to the restaurant, add a tip, and pay seperately with a card system that takes forever to verify your pin code, connect to the host, and ultimately transfer the money. With these bio-integrated tattoos you would be able to just be able to transfer the money without hassle, since they are connected to your DNA it would just take a high five to transfer the money from one person to the other, no pin-code needed.
      <br><br>
      This system could be controlled from a smartphone, because of course you don't want to transfer money to someone each time you shake their hand. You could initiate the payment from your smartphone, touch the person with a bio-integrated tattoo, and be done with it. The tattoo itself works just like an NFC chip so it doesnt need to be charged, and doesnt emit any kind of potentialy harmful radiation.
      <br><br>
      So in short, never wait in line to pay for small things again. Just high-five!</p>
